# Implementing File Operations for EXT2

### Description

Wrote a set of tools in C to modify ext2 formatted virtual disk images. The assignment handout provided a list of programs (cp, ln, mkdir, restore, ) and their specifications, to be implemented after researching the EXT2 file system.

### Reflection

Coming soon...
